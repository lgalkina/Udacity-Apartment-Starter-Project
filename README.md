# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Experience

###Time to complete project: 
The project was more time consuming than I thought. Most of the time was spent on 3d objects positioning, materials adjusting, finding out how to make the globe rotate as it is required and light baking. The more I increased the light baking resolution, I got brighter effects of light sources in the scene, but the time of baking also increased significantly.

###What I liked: 
I enjoyed building my own scene starting from adding 3d objects to adjusting cameras and lights settings. I liked to expreiment with lights properties (brightness, range, angle, etc.) to see how they changed the look of the apartment. 

###What was challenging: 
I ran into a couple of issues that I was able to resolve: 
1. Missing Prefab issue (as I know now renaming assets should be done only inside Unity)
2. Materials are not shown correctly (light baking solved the problem)
3. Globe rotation was a little bit challenging (finally was able to construct the required animation state machine)
